Access tokens and refresh tokens are commonly used in authentication and authorization processes, especially in systems utilizing OAuth 2.0. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

### Access Token
1. **Definition**: An access token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API. It typically represents the user's permission for the application to access specific resources.
2. **Lifetime**: Access tokens are usually short-lived, meaning they expire after a certain period (often minutes or hours).
3. **Usage**: When a client (such as a mobile app or web app) wants to access a protected resource, it presents the access token to the resource server. The server then verifies the token before allowing access.
4. **Security**: Because access tokens are short-lived, the risk associated with token leakage is reduced. However, they must be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access.

### Refresh Token
1. **Definition**: A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. It allows the application to maintain access over a longer period without storing the user's credentials.
2. **Lifetime**: Refresh tokens are typically long-lived and can last days, weeks, or even indefinitely until revoked.
3. **Usage**: When an access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authorization server. This process involves sending the refresh token along with the client credentials to the token endpoint.
4. **Security**: Refresh tokens must be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access, as they can be used to obtain new access tokens. If compromised, they should be revoked immediately.

### How They Work Together
1. **Authentication**: The user logs in and the authorization server issues both an access token and a refresh token.
2. **Access Resource**: The client uses the access token to access protected resources.
3. **Token Expiry**: When the access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
4. **Continued Access**: This cycle continues until the refresh token itself expires or is revoked.

### Example Flow
1. **User Authentication**: 
   - The user logs in using their credentials.
   - The authorization server verifies the credentials and issues an access token and a refresh token to the client.
   
2. **Accessing Resources**:
   - The client makes API requests using the access token.
   - The resource server validates the access token before granting access to the resources.

3. **Token Renewal**:
   - When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the authorization server.
   - The authorization server validates the refresh token and issues a new access token (and possibly a new refresh token).

### Example Tokens (JSON Web Token - JWT)
- **Access Token**:
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
  ```

- **Refresh Token**:
  ```json
  {
    "refresh_token": "def50200a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 604800
  }
  ```

### Security Considerations
1. **Secure Storage**: Both access and refresh tokens should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Token Expiry**: Use short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens to balance security and usability.
3. **Revocation**: Implement mechanisms to revoke tokens if they are compromised.

By understanding and implementing access and refresh tokens properly, you can create a secure and user-friendly authentication system.
